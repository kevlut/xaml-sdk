The purpose of this topic is to demonstrate how you may use the special slots feature of RadTimeBar. It provides the following four samples:
	
	-WeekDaysGenerator - It demonstrates a customizable slot, where the first day and the duration of the period can be set.
	-WorkDaysGenerator - It is a specific case of the WeekDaysGenerator, where the period Monday to Friday is marked for every week.
	-WeekendGenerator - Similarly to the WeekDaysGenerator, Saturday and Sunday are marked.
	-MonthDayGenerator - It is a customizable slot, where you have a reccuring day once in the month. For instance, every 15th day of the month.
